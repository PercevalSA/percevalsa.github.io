I’m Perceval — a computer enthusiast into Linux, embedded systems, and automation.
I like understanding how things work by tinkering and breaking them down. I enjoy making stuff — sometimes it works, sometimes it’s just interesting. 
If you're into cyber stuff and half-baked prototypes, you're in the right place.
