# BSOD is dead
Microsoft killed the blue screen of the death. It has been with us for 40 years and changed of form and text many times. It will be a black screen from now on.

To celebrate the life and death of the blue screen, I started an Instagram account where I will publish all BSOD and crash screen Encountered in my life.
I will only publish photo of screens present in a public space or  visible from a public area (store, train station, street...).
The goal here is to raise attention on computers failures. Computers are used everywhere in our daily lives even in the most unsuspected areas. Any failure can generate big issues (like the crowd strike gate).
We rely on computer for more than necessary and are powerless when they crash.

you can find the account [on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dasbsod/)
