# BSOD is dead
Microsoft killed the blue screen of death. It has been with us for 40 years and has changed form and text many times. It will be a black screen from now on.

To celebrate the life and death of the blue screen, I started an Instagram account where I will publish all BSOD and crash screens I have encountered in my life.
I will only publish photos of screens present in public spaces or visible from public areas (stores, train stations, streets...).
The goal here is to raise awareness about computer failures. Computers are used everywhere in our daily lives, even in the most unexpected areas. Any failure can generate big issues (like the CrowdStrike outage). We rely on computers more than necessary and are powerless when they crash.

You can find the account [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dasbsod/).
